2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Model training and evaluation.

## Results
- Mean Value: 45.3
- Model Accuracy: 92%
- Visualizations reveal a positive correlation between X and Y.

## Conclusion
The analysis supports that X has a significant impact on Y, and the predictive model is robust for future use.
